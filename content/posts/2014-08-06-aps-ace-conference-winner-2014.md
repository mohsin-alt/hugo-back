The Albuquerque Public Schools Administrators Conference on Education (ACE) was held July 31- August 1, 2014 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. School and District Administrators were in attendance. The district of 94,000+ students holds this annual conference to give attendees a better understanding of district goals and objectives for the school year.  
Backbone Communications was on site to share information on the product and services we provide to improve student success in school and life. A special contest was held for conference attendees who visited the Backbone booth. Toby Herrera, the Director of the Student, School, and Community Service Center won $50 in movie passes.  
**Congratulations Toby Herrera!**
