Sedona Red Rock High School Principal Dave Lykins kicks back during a surprise party for him at the school May 26. Staff members hosted the party for Lykins after learning he was chosen as Principal of the Year by the Arizona School Administrators Association.

People are always pleased to honor someone they know, and it?s even better when they can have fun in the process.  
Fun is exactly what the staff at Sedona Red Rock High School had when they surprised Principal David Lykins with a congratulatory breakfast  
May 26. The Sedona-Oak Creek School District received a notification May 21 Lykins had been named Arizona High School Principal of the Year by the Arizona School Administrators Association, District Superintend  
ent Mike Aylstock said.  
?I nominated him with letters of support from Elaine Vail and Karyl Goldsmith. After working with Dave for two years I thought it was appropriate to honor him,? Aylstock said. ?I have been an administrator for 19 years. I have never worked with a better high school principal than Dave Lykins.?  
In response, Lykins said he appreciated the recognition, and a lot of credit should go to school staff, parents, teachers and students.  
?It?s always nice to be recognized for your hard work, commitment to do the right thing for kids. This is a career I chose and when I look back on my 25 years, I know I made the right one [choice]. I love working here with the kids, the parents, teachers and the community,? Lykins said.  
Vail asked 11 random students to describe Lykins and received 11 different, positive descriptions. Ten teachers she asked gave 10 different, yet similar replies. She asked the students and teachers because she said SRRHS is a community and everyone should have some input. She included the responses in her letter.  
?As the educational leader of our  
school, Mr. Lykins sets a tone of respect by honoring others? talents and empowering members of the school community to work toward a common vision of academic excellence. I have frequently witnessed Mr. Lykins build rapport with students and parents as he listens, cajoles, guides, encourages and expects academic excellence,? Vail wrote in her letter.  
Teachers Marc Sterling and Mal Cooper put together video skits using a computer skit program and placed teachers? faces on the characters to liven up the breakfast.  
Two of the skits shown on screen featured Lykins ? one as a dancer in a 1980s ?Soul Train? episode, and one of him dancing the hula with a coconut shell bra.  
In a third skit, five teachers  
were featured as Chippendale dancers, and another skit featured four teachers as ?Star Wars? characters escaped from the Empire?s forces.  
Through every skit the teachers roared with laughter, especially when they saw their face on one of the characters.  
?It?s a fun way to end the year,? Goldsmith said.
