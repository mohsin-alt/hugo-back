The international system has witnessed dramatic changes in the recent past. Developments around the globe and at home challenge us to rethink the role of the United States in the international community. What is our nation&#8217;s place in this increasingly complex global picture? How do we best promote respect for human rights and the growth of freedom and justice? What can we do to nurture and preserve international security and world peace?  
Our country depends on knowledgeable and thoughtful students like you?the next generation of leaders?to build peace with freedom and justice among nations and peoples. In the belief that questions about peace, justice, freedom, and security are vital to civic education, we established the National Peace Essay Contest to expand educational opportunities for America&#8217;s youth.

##### The National Peace Essay Contest:

  * Promotes serious discussion among high school students, teachers, and national leaders about international peace and conflict resolution today and in the future;
  * Complements existing curricula and other scholastic activities;
  * Strengthens students&#8217; research, writing, and reasoning skills; and
  * Meets National Contents Standards.
