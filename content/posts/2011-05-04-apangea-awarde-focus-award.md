Apangea Awarded Prestigious FOCUS AWARD  
Outstanding Results and Service Turns into Long-Term Partnership for Garland ISD and Apangea  
PITTSBURGH, Pa &#8211; April 29, 2011 &#8211; Apangea Learning announced today that the Garland Independent School District (ISD), one of the largest districts in Texas, has honored the company with its prestigious FOCUS award. The award commends Apangea Learning for its extraordinary service in implementing and supporting the district.  
&#8220;Apangea Learning has provided Garland ISD with a superb math intervention program along with a caring and supportive partnership,&#8221; stated Dr. Theresa Williams, Garland&#8217;s Director of Special Programs. &#8220;Company representatives, Christine Riviello and Jayson Cox have been dedicated and committed to the success of our students and teachers by providing us with hands-on training and support from the administrative level down to the classroom and actual students. Apangea Learning not only cares about student success, but also the success of the teacher.&#8221;  
Apangea&#8217;s partnership with Garland ISD began in 2008 when the district was searching for a multi-lingual supplemental program to support English language learners with critical-thinking and problem-solving skills. Apangea was so successful that Garland ISD expanded the online program to students in grades 5-12 for four additional years.  
&#8220;We are honored to receive Garland&#8217;s FOCUS award. We are committed to providing excellent support which ensures that Apangea is implemented effectively so that it maximizes learning outcomes,&#8221; stated Jeremy Trabucco, Vice President of Operations and Account Services. &#8220;We are thrilled to have a long-term partnership with Garland-it allows us to become more effective each year in empowering their students with the skills and confidence they need for academic success.&#8221;
