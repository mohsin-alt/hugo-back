            With the current Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) scheduled to be reauthorized in the spring of 2014, considerations for a change in policy to more successfully address the educational needs of all students is imminent. The amendments in 2004 to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) promoted greater access to the general education curriculum for students with disabilities.The option to utilize a framework of Multi-tiered System of Supports (MTSS) and principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) opened up dialogue for making this special law more aligned with ESEA. A cohesive alignment of IDEA and ESEA, with bridged frameworks of MTSS and UDL, may just be what is needed to reshape our educational system to be effective for every student.
