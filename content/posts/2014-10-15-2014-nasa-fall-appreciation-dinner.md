**Backbone Communications, a Silver Level sponsor of NASA for the last 7 years, is sponsoring their semiannual Appreciation Dinner at the Prime Rib Loft, Monday November 17, 2014, at 6:30pm.**  
As Implementations Manager for Nevada, I am most excited to have one of our trainers, and **Billy Jack Garren** from **<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #99ccff;"><a title="eInstruction" href="http://www.einstruction.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #99ccff; text-decoration: underline;">eInstruction</span></a></span>** with me as hosts. Billy Jack will be presenting earlier that day on the idea held by ISTE: ?Technology, used effectively, can help all students meet and exceed the rigorous learning goals embedded in the Common Core State Standards by providing access to tools and resources that personalize instruction and creating rich, engaging and relevant learning environments.?  
**NASA Fall Appreciation Dinner sponsored by Backbone Communications**  
**When**: Monday, November 17, 2014 @ 6:30PM  
**Dress**: Vegas Casual  
**Who&#8217;s Invited**: You, Your Spouse, Partner, or Special Staff Associates  
**Please RSVP no later than Friday, November 14, 2014**  
In addition, we are introducing a new partner, <span style="color: #99ccff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a title="LearnBop" href="http://www.learnbop.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #99ccff; text-decoration: underline;">LearnBop</span></a></span></span></strong>.</span>? LearnBop is an adaptive math learning tool for 5th through 9th grade algebra and algebra readiness, which simultaneously assesses, diagnoses, and tracks student mastery. Students and teachers have access to over 3,000 step-by-step interactive tutorials. When a student needs help, the LearnBop automated tutoring system breaks the problem down so the student can work through it step-by-step, at their own pace, and provides data to the teacher to help them identify targeted interventions aligned to specific concepts that students need assistance in learning.  
The ?bops,? or Behavior Optimization Protocols, are customized math problems. Each bop checks for understanding by asking the student to make sense of the problem, reason abstractly and quantitatively, and answer the question correctly. If a student makes a mistake or asks for help, the automated tutoring system breaks the problem down and guides the student. The one-on-one interactive platform offers hints, visuals, and videos for each student to self-pace in order to gain mastery before moving on to the next concept.
