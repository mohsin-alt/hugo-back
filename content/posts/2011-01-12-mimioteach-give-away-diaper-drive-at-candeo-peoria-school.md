Candeo is supporting the Diaper Drive for Homeward Bound. Homeward bound is a Hand-up, not a Hand-out program, which assists homeless and domestic violence families with the goal of getting people back on their feet within 12-24 months. They have a 95% success rate.  
If you are interested in donating to the diaper drive, or interested in getting Candeo a MimioTeach (aka donating to the diaper drive). Please do ASAP!! Every diaper makes a difference and this really is a worthwhile cause.
