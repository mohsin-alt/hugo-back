The ECS is responsible for helping teachers integrate technology into their curriculum, keeping records, maintaining the school&#8217;s LAN, inventory, and basic troubleshooting. ITS is responsible for supporting the ECS&#8217;s. An advisory committee of ECSs and ITS personnel meets regularly to determine training needs and help with support issues.
