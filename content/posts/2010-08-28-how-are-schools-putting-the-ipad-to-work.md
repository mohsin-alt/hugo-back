?I think we realize that at some point in the future, textbooks will be digital and that we?ll be using a device like the iPad in the classroom,? said George Saltsman, Director of Educational Technology for the?[Adams Center for Teaching and Learning at Abilene Christian University][3], where the device will be used in two classes this fall. ?I don?t know that we?re ready to say that we?ll do that next year, but I do think that in five years all our students will be getting their texts digitally.?  
**Catalyst for classroom participation** At?[Abilene Christian][4]?where the iPad is being distributed to 100 students in two pilot program classes?Dr. Ian Shepherd has designed his fall Econ 261 class to incorporate a?[digital textbook from McGraw-Hill][5], the?[Blackboard Learning Mobile app][6], as well as PDFs of supplemental texts. He?s perhaps most excited about the No Advance NOtice (NANO), an ACU-built assessment tool that lets him instantly quiz the entire class using polls, true-false questions and open-ended essay queries. He believes that tool will help him draw reticent students into classroom discussions. He?s taking aim at the ?20-80 Rule??the belief among educators that 20 percent of students dominate classroom time.
