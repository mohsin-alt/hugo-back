    ?Secrets? of High-Quality Interactive Lesson Content
    Interactive lesson planning is much like what we were taught when we first learned how to write lesson plans. The only difference is that now we have the power of interactivity to incorporate into our lesson design. It opens the realm of possibilities to tap into every student?s unique learning style, otherwise known as differentiation. Planning is not arbitrary but skillful, with deliberate decisions being made every step of the way.
