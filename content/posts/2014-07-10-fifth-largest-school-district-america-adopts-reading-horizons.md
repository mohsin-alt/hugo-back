**Clark County, Nevada, joins an increasing number of school districts using _Reading Horizons Elevate_ with English Language Learners.**  
What began as a one-off implementation of _Reading Horizons Elevate_ by Backbone Communications at a high school in Clark County, Nevada, has grown to district-wide adoption of the results-driven reading program. This coming school year, with ongoing training and on onsite workshops provided by Backbone Communications, Clark County School District will implement _Reading Horizons Elevate_ in 117 middle and high schools, joining other large districts in the country that have chosen the program for English Language Learners (ELLs) 4th grade and older.  
To make sure its students are receiving the most effective reading instruction possible, Clark County School District is also beefing up teacher training. Twenty-eight district ELL administrators have already received two days of training in the Reading Horizons method?the initial step for becoming Certified Reading Horizons trainers. In the next few months, those administrators will continue on the path to certification by attending and participating in a five-day Trainer Certification Workshop, in which they will be taught the method in-depth and observed instructing skills. Both during and after these workshops, Backbone Communications&#8217; reading specialists will guide their progress to successfully complete a Teacher Certification Exam. The district?s ultimate goal is to have this certified team train all of the ELL teachers in all 117 schools.  
Charity agencies and multicultural centers in Clark County pioneered use of _Reading Horizons Elevate_ to help adults learn to read. Success stories spread by word of mouth across the state, leading other educators to consider the program for their own schools. In 2010, with support and training from the Backbone Team, various ABE and ELL directors from Nevada community colleges began using _Reading Horizons Elevate_ with their students. Today, the program is in use at all Nevada community colleges. In 2011, Backbone Communications approached the Clark County Library System for a Reading Horizons pilot in its CALL program to help non-native and struggling adult students. After the 3-month pilot, Backbone Communications helped design a comprehensive package including software licenses, direct instruction materials, and onsite workshops. The results have been ?fabulous? according to Ms. Rhea Watson, Literacy coach at the CALL Program. Most recently, Backbone Communications implemented _Reading Horizons Elevate_ for a large junior/senior high school in Elko County. A similar package is also being adopted in August for middle school students in Churchill County.  
_Reading Horizons Elevate_ offers direct instruction materials and software that can be combined or used independently, which gives schools the flexibility to customize implementation.
