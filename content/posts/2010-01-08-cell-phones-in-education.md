## <span style="color: #000000;">Popularity of texting edging out cell phone calls</span>

<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">
  WASHINGTON ? R u kidding me? Americans punched out more than 110 billion text messages last year, double the number in the previous year and growing, as the shorthand communication becomes a popular alternative to cell phone calls.
</p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">
  The nation&#8217;s 270 million cell phone subscribers each sent out an average of 407 text messages in 2008, according to government statistics released Tuesday by the Census Bureau. That&#8217;s more than double the 188 messages sent by the average cell subscriber in 2007. The figures did not break down the texting by age, but the overall numbers understate the thousands of texts sent each month by many teens ? balanced out by older folks who don&#8217;t text as much.

<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">
  &#8220;We are seeing a clear trend of huge increases in text messaging,&#8221; said Amanda Lenhart, senior research specialist at the Pew Internet and American Life Project. &#8220;If teens are a leader for America, then we are moving to a text-based communication system. For them, there is less interest in talking.&#8221;

<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">
  Her research found the average teen currently sends more than 2,000 text messages per month. About two-thirds of all teens use text messaging, mostly due to its simplicity as well as the privacy of being able to communicate without being overheard.

<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">
  Lenhart predicted that texting would continue to grow as parents begin using it as an easy way to reach their kids. <a title="Cell Phones in Education" href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hUcQHKKuU7Uw8X8A5YsjtsEe-hFAD9CJS2280" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> < Read More ></a>
