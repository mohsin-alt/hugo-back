The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) is designed to stimulate the American economy by providing jobs and educating our children. These historic funding levels will help states re-fund their education budgets, keep teachers and hire more teachers, provide quality professional development, bring services to disadvantaged students and failing schools, and bring American education into the technology age.  
AutoSkill solutions align closely to many federal programs included in the Recovery Act Stimulus Package. Funding sources can often be commingled to purchase AutoSkill solutions for use in programs that meet the needs of different student groups. <a href="http://www.autoskill.com/pdf/funding/Funding_RecoveryAct_Matrix2009.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here</a> to download the AutoSkill Recovery Act Funding Matrix. <a href="http://autoskill.com/funding/recovery_act.php" title="Recovery Act Funds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more&#8230;</a>
