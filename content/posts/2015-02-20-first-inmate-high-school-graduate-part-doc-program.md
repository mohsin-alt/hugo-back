PHOENIX (KSAZ) &#8211; It&#8217;s a first for the Arizona Department of Corrections, one of its inmates graduated high school while serving her sentence.  
We&#8217;re not talking about a GED, this is an actual diploma.  
It&#8217;s a brand new program being implemented in just a handful of prisons.  
Behind the heavily guarded gates that lead to the entrance of Perryville Prison in Goodyear, inmates like Ashleigh Gibbons are making the most of their time behind bars.  
&#8220;I have about three years left,&#8221; said Ashleigh Gibbons.  
Gibbons who is six month into her sentence has already accomplished something no other inmate can say they have done, at least not in the State of Arizona. On January 28, 2015 Gibbons graduated high school.  
&#8220;Good, I feel accomplished, I don&#8217;t feel like I am so behind anymore, I feel good, I feel proud of myself,&#8221; she said.
