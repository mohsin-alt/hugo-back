**Correlation to****?****Common****?****Core**  
Many educators and teachers already know about?common core, but some don&#8217;t.  
The?Reading?Horizons?reading?system aligns with?Common Core?State Standards and now you can easily find that correlation on our website.  
Common?Core?State Standards provide a consistent, clear understanding of what students are expected to learn, so teachers and parents know what they need to do to help them. The standards are designed to be robust and relevant to the real world, reflecting the knowledge and skills that our young people need for success in college and careers.
