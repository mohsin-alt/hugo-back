<span style="color: #000000;"><em>Arizona&#8217;s new reading law has high stakes (HB2732)</em><br /> <em>Proficiency a must to advance grade levels</em><br /> <em>by Kerry Fehr-Snyder &#8211; Oct. 14, 2011 12:00 AM</em></span>

### <span style="color: #000000;">The Arizona Republic</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">This year&#8217;s Arizona first-graders must prove they can read proficiently in three years or they&#8217;ll be held back in school.</span>  
<span style="color: #000000;">That shines a spotlight on first-grade classrooms like Tanya Pawl&#8217;s in central Phoenix, where 6- and 7-year-olds spend hours each school day learning how to put their A-B-Cs to use.</span>  
<span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;First grade is so important,&#8221; said Pawl, a teacher for 10 years. &#8220;The teacher has so much magic in that.&#8221;</span>  
<span style="color: #000000;">Starting in 2013-14, all third-graders in Arizona must prove that they are reading proficiently. If they fail, they will not advance to fourth grade.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Reading well by third grade is vital to future academic success, studies show. And fluency &#8211; reading with comprehension and intonation &#8211; predicts eventual high-school graduation, according to the American Educational Research Association.</span>  
<span style="color: #000000;">Last year, the Arizona Legislature passed, and the governor signed, the high-stakes reading mandate, House Bill 2732, titled Move On When Reading, which is modeled after a 2002 Florida law. Other states, including Massachusetts, Indiana and Utah, have similar laws.</span>  
<span style="color: #000000;">Arizona has a lot of ground to make up. More than 4,000 third-graders statewide fell &#8220;far below&#8221; the third-grade reading standards on the spring 2011 Arizona&#8217;s Instrument to Measure Standards test.</span>
