## HISTORY OF THE TRUST

The Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust was established upon the death of Nina Mason Pulliam on March 26, 1997, to support for 50 years the causes she loved in her home states of Arizona and Indiana.  
The Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust seeks to help people in need, especially women, children and families; to protect animals and nature; and to enrich community life primarily in metropolitan Phoenix and Indianapolis.  
In 2001, the Trust established the Nina Mason Pulliam Legacy Scholars program in tribute to the life and values of its benefactress. Participating schools are Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), Ivy Tech State College-Indianapolis Campus, Arizona State University (ASU), and Maricopa Community Colleges (MCC).

    SCOPE OF FUNDING
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    Requests for funding may be submitted at any time throughout the year; however, proposal review and funding decisions occur two times per year. In 2012, the Trust expects to distribute approximately $14.3 million in grants. (Final distribution amounts depend on the performance of the Trust&#8217;s invested assets.) Generally, the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust prefers to disburse funds as a one-year grant, but not for a period longer than three years. Requests for funding are limited to one request per organization per calendar year. For these purposes, an &#8220;organization&#8221; generally refers to that entity to which the IRS has issued a Section 501(c)(3) determination letter. If an organization received a previous grant, a final evaluation report must be submitted and reviewed by Trust staff prior to requesting another grant.
