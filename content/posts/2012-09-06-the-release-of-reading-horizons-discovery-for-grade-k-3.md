**Reading Horizons Discovery: Changes to the Curriculum**  
Tuesday, September 11, 2012 4:00 PM &#8211; 5:00 PM EDT  
<a href="https://www2.gotomeeting.com/register/410904362" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Webinar Registration</a>  
The new Reading Horizons Discovery program teaches a variety of strategies to teach young readers effective decoding and spelling skills. While the former version of the elementary program, Discover Intensive Phonics, taught extremely effective principles, changes were necessary to better accommodate teacher and student needs. These changes were made based on teacher feedback while maintaining high fidelity to the method.  
This webinar will discuss modifications to the Reading Horizons Discovery curriculum, including:  
-Specific changes to the content and sequence to better accommodate needs.  
-Differentiation between the Kindergarten and the Grades 1-3 sequence.  
-Changes to the Most Common Words lists and language and grammar lessons (Reference Lessons).  
The webinar will be presented by one of the primary authors of the new materials, Reading Horizons Curriculum Director, Heidi Hyte.
