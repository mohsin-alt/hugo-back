Students will be able to watch their own silica nanospheres drop gently (settle) in beakers that will form into the opal crystals over a period of weeks.  
Typical subjects would include:

  <li>
    How opal is formed in the earth
  </li>
  <li>
    Light?Diffraction
  </li>
  <li>
    Nanoparticles
  </li>
  <li>
    Self?Assembly
  </li>
</ul>

Students will come away with a comprehensive understanding of micro technology and one of the true wonders of natural science in opal formation. As nanotechnology proves to be the future of manufacturing, students will gain a ground level understanding of what this exciting field has to offer.
