_According to Newsweek, the local teachers union is infuriated over the?[disclosure of teacher performance metrics][1]. Quoting: &#8216;Do parents have the right to know which of their kids&#8217; teachers are the most and least effective? That&#8217;s the controversy roaring in California this week with the publication of an?[investigative series][2] by the Los Angeles Times&#8217;s Jason Song and Jason Felch, who used seven years of math and English test data to publicly identify the best and the worst third- to fifth-grade teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District. The newspaper&#8217;s announcement of its plans to release data later this month on all 6,000 of the city&#8217;s elementary-school teachers has prompted the local teachers&#8217; union to rally members to organize a boycott of the newspaper.&#8217; According to the linked Times article, United Teachers Los Angeles president A.J.

The disclosures are unprecedented, and it remains unclear whether other school districts or newspapers will follow suit; local laws prevent some school districts from publicly identifying their most ineffective teachers by name.
