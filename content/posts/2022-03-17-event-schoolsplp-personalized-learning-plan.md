Blended and Online Learning has evolved drastically over the past 10 years. During this time, countless Learning Management Systems and Content Management Systems have been used in schools. Commonly, limiting the ability to create and share, have choice, and manage data in a single platform. We are excited to present a new phase in technological development!

With these systems in place, we are greatly reducing the need for extended professional development and “new teacher training”.
