=======================  
Below are a few questions that we used to help and challenge our schools to better their instructional models.  
Can you predict within 2% points how  
well each student will do on AIMS in the  
first week of school?  
Can you instantly identify what gaps the  
students have in their learning and provide  
individualized remediation?  
Can you measure percentage increases  
or decreases toward mastery each week?  
&#8230;And do you make timely (daily) changes based on your data?  
Can your curriculum monitoring system  
provide instant standards aligned intervention  
and multiple on-going assessments to  
measure the effectiveness of your curriculum  
delivery system?  
Our curriculum & assessment management tools monitor for  
its success and failure, and make positive changes that help our  
students meet the Standards.  
In addition, our assessments help us identify students in need of  
interventions and prescribe solutions and new  
curriculum in a timely (same-day) way.
