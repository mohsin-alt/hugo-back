To get you prepared for the coming school year we are pleased to have Ilene Val-Essen, Ph.D. provide you with tips for maximizing the cooperation, learning, and success that will take place in your classroom during this coming school year.  
Participants will:  
? Recognize the importance of attitudes, and how they are even more valuable than effective communication.  
? Be introduced to the attitudes of respect, which encourage cooperation and increase learning.  
? Discover that as we bring out the best in our students, we discover the best within ourselves.
