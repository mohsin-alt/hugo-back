Our students can focus on learning and our teachers can spend time teaching. We didn’t need extended professional development like other online programs we have used.

## Program Details

**Track progress clearly and simply.**

Every student has a progress bar showing at a glance whether he’s on pace to complete his courses on time: the bar is green for on-track or ahead, amber for behind, and red for far behind. It doesn’t get any easier.

**Answer the important questions instantly.**

Which students are far behind? Who hasn’t logged in lately? Is Tina getting enough done? Do I need to grade any essays? Which students are earning Ds or Fs in their courses? Sort it out with a click and a glance using the class summary screens.

**Stay in touch with the entire school.**  
**Stay in touch with each student.**

Want to tell the whole school that assignments must be finished before the quarter ends on Friday? Want to congratulate Katherine for doing better in geometry? In SchoolsPLP, you?re never more than 3 clicks from communicating with your students.

**Set realistic, personalized student goals.**

Is the default pace too slow for a student? Is it too fast? Do you want to block schedule? With just a few clicks, teachers can change course due dates for any student. All of SchoolsPLP’s progress indicators will reflect the student’s personalized goals.
