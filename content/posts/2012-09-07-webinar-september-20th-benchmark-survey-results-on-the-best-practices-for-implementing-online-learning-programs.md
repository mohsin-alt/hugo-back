**Benchmark Survey Results on the Best Practices for Implementing Online Learning Programs**  
**Join us for an upcoming webinar!**  
**Thursday, 9/20 @ 2PM Eastern**  
?Benchmark Survey Results on the Best Practices for Implementing Online Learning Programs?  
As an educator, you know that implementing online learning can be a complex process, and a smooth implementation is critical for success. ?MDR Education Market Research recently conducted a survey of over 220 educators at all levels on the most critical success factors for implementing credit recovery, online courses, and full time programs.  
In 45 minutes, you&#8217;ll learn what your peers consider the most important attributes to running a successful online program.  
Topics to be covered include:

  * The four highest rated factors that are critical to a successful implementation of credit recovery, online courses, and full time online schooling
  * The different implementation best practices unique to each of these program types
  * How many of your peers are creating online learning curricula in-house vs. working with partners
  * Districts? view the cost of online learning vs. traditional learning

Join us on September 20th to review these results with us. We think you will find these results insightful, and that you will be able to take away some valuable information on how to ensure the success of your online learning initiatives.
