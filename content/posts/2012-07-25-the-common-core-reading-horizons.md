The new Common Core State Standards (CCSS) call for an increase in students reading informational text; 50% informational text in K-5, 55% informational text in 6-8, and 70% informational text in 9-12. The Reading Horizons software provides schools instant access to informational texts at each student?s reading level. ?Instant access to the information text within Reading Horizons includes reading with titles like Robots, Laser Eye Surgery, and Sports Heroes.  
Below is a wonderful two-minute video explaining this new reading requirement.  
You will notice that Susan Pimentel mentions 80% informational text in the video which refers to students being ?college and career ready? when they graduate.
