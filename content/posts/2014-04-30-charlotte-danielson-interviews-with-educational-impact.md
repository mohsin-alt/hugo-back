To prepare for the 2014/2015 school year, I wanted to ask you a couple questions:

  * Are you spending a fortune on workshops and PD seminars hoping your teachers and administrators are ready for Nevada&#8217;s new evaluation mandates?
  * Are you frustrated and confused by high cost vendors falsely claiming to be exclusive providers of Danielson Framework training?

**_Stop the insanity?your school or district has a much better and more cost-effective option to meet the new standards._**  
Educational Impact and Charlotte Danielson have created a comprehensive series of powerful online programs that include over 17 hours of engaging online video?all developed for NV schools that are implementing the Danielson Framework.

    For example:
  </p>
  
  <div>
    <h2>
      Step One: Learn the 22 Components
    </h2>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Drawing on years of research and personal experience, Charlotte reviews each of the four domains and 22 Framework components. In three hours of insightful video, Charlotte offers teachers a coherent collection of practical classroom strategies and techniques to enhance their skills in each component area. Charlotte then explores why each component of the Framework is important and how they work together to define &#8220;good teaching.&#8221; Using an array of examples, Charlotte examines the challenges your teachers will face in achieving a &#8220;distinguished&#8221; level for each component.<br /> The final module of the program features compelling video of new teachers posing frequently asked questions directly to Charlotte.<br /> The program also includes four multiple-choice assessments to ensure comprehension. To assist with accountability, administrative reports are available to monitor viewing progress and assessment completion. These are optional features that many school districts find useful.
