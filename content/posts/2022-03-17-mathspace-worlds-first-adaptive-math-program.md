Pilots are more successful when ed-tech companies are willing to act as thought partners during the planning phase.” – Mineola Public School District

**Digital Promise Study**

The <a title="Digital Promise Rapid Cycle Pilots - Mathspace" href="http://backbonecommunications.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Mathspace-Pilots_Digital-Promise-rapid-cycle-pilots-mathsixdistricts.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Promise Rapid Cycle Pilots</a> is a formal research study published by Digital Promise, based on our 6 month pilot last year in 5 Digital Promise league of innovative schools districts.

  * It is a robust, well-presented study, that illustrates our experience in running long-term and complex pilots with school districts. For those in the US, this informs our “District Pilot Playbook” that we produce for large pilots.
  * The results are positive: Of the five pilot districts, four had statistically significant improvements to their math scores. The fifth had a non-significant change.
  * Mineola, which did implement well, saw a 17% increase in their math test scores.

_**Despite the fact that all but one pilot was not used with fidelity; imagine how good the results could have been if implemented with fidelity.**_
