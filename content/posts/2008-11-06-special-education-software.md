Special Education covers a wide range of abilities, both behaviorally and academically. Often times, Reading and Mathematics are areas where much attention is needed. See [Reading Intervention Software][1] and [Math Intervention Software][2].  
Schools help their students who are in need of &#8220;Special Education&#8221; or &#8220;Exceptional Student Services&#8221; in many different ways. Small group instruction, individual attention and the use of computer/software are the most common attempts to intervention and educate. Software has the ability to differentiate instruction easily. For school-wide testing and understanding multi-tiered models, see [Universal Screening][3].  
_**Side note:**_ Many teachers and educators spend much of their time pulling curriculum and finding the lessons specific for their students on an individual basis. Well, is it not the teachers job to find the lessons the students need? That is a false statement. There are many duties required in a teacher. The foremost of these include, creating a safe, risk-free environment, planning creative lesson plans to teach and reinforce the learning objectives, and making critical decisions when the student is NOT learning what is being taught.  
What does this have to do with Special Education software? Very simply, individual lessons prescribed to the students automatically on an individual basis allows teachers and educators the time to focus on the other things mentioned above. See [State Standards Aligned Curriculum][4]. On an academic level, Special Education means [Differentiated Instruction][5] in its truest form. Every student learns differently and are performing at different levels.  
Software not only has the ability to test and prescribe lessons, but also to intervene automatically, within the lessons, when students are not successful. Tracking interventions and progress monitoring are other areas where software is beneficial.  
What is the ultimate goal? Give the students the RIGHT instruction at the RIGHT time and THEN data driven decision making makes sense.
