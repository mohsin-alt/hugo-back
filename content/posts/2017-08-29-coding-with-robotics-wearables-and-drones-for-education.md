My name is Pramod Abichadani and I?m the CEO and founder of LocoRobo. I have a PhD in Robotics and I am a University Professor. I come from a very heavy academic background. Because of this, I understand the tension educators and academics have to go through when adopting modern technology in their classroom and managing the barriers to entry that come with it. Our goal here at LocoRobo is simple; We want to support you, the educators and administrators, in bringing modern, digital, scientific and technological literacy tools into your classroom. LocoRobo is the only company in the United States that has a full-blown modern robotics and coding ecosystem. As part of this ecosystem, we have ground robots, drones and wearable devices. The best part about each robot that we offer is that they can be used seamlessly starting in K-2 right up to 8th-12th grade and everybody in the middle. I highly encourage you to register today and learn more about the LocoRobo ecosystem.

  * **Grades 3-7:** Project Based Learning (PBL) curriculum for Robotics, Coding and STEM. Standards Aligned. ??Empower your students for the future with hands-on engagement in real world coding and robotics. Effortlessly.
  * **Grades 8-12:** Teach students to become proficient coders in critical real-world programming languages within 3-6 months.??Teach Real-World Coding for Real-World Students. Effortlessly.

**Products**

  * LocoRobo Academy?: Cloud platform that hosts Coding environment and Lessons
  * LocoExtreme?: A programmable tank-like ground robot with Bluetooth Low Energy communication
  * LocoDrone?: A programmable drone + controller platform
  * LocoWear?: A programmable wireless wearable device for analyzing physical activity using motion sensors
