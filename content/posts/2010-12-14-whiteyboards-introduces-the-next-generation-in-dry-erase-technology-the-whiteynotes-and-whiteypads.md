A few things really stand out as watershed moments in human history. The Polio vaccine and the moon landing are two, perhaps, and maybe there?s that whole Hadron collider thing. But when it comes to true breakthroughs I?d have to add one more to the list: the Whiteyboard. As you recall, Whiteyboards are big panels of dry-erase plastic that you can stick to any wall in the house or office. They are removable without damage to the underlying surface and they?re significantly cheaper than any other whiteboard solutions out there. The company just introduced WhiteyNotes, dry-erase sticky notes, and WhiteyPads, to-do list-type sheets for kitchens and/or kink dungeons.  
The notes come in Post-It size and cost $5 for ten. The pads come for $8 per 10 and are 5?8 inches. Both are infinitely reusable, assuming a repeating, never-ending universe and not accounting for entropy. The company is a former YCombinator start-up.  
The items are shipping now and they work a treat. I have one up in my office now and I feel like a real big-time journalist with a to-do list and everything.
