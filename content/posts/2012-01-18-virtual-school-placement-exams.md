        Preparing to Take the Exams
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        It&#8217;s recommended a student should set aside at least one hour to complete an exam. Be sure the student is clear of distractions and has access to paper and pencils.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        Taking the Exams
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        To the student: All questions should be attempted. Be sure to use the space provided to solve problems. The back of the exam sheet can also be used if needed. Write the answer in the proper location so when the exam is being graded, the answers are easy to find. Write clearly and accurately. Be sure to answer the questions completely and avoid answers containing more than one possibility. You should feel confident enough about your answer to clearly state it. If you absolutely get stuck on a question, leave the question blank.<br /> Remember, the goal is to help students be placed in the correct course. If students do not do their own work, their results may not accurately reflect their placement level and potentially placed in a course they are not ready for.
