One of the biggest mistakes schools are making is to fall in love with the latest devices and invest in technology for technology&#8217;s sake.  
Improving schools does not need to be a matter of guesswork. The value of sound theory is that it provides a pattern for what to do to be successful.  
When launching something that is unfamiliar and unpredicatable, with a low ratio of knowledge to hypotheses, educators need to change the planning and design process. A standard planning process &#8211; making a plan, looking at the projected outcomes from the plan, and then, assuming those outcomes look desirable, implementing it &#8211; will not work, because the assumptions, both implicit and explicit, on which the outcomes rest are often wrong.  
Therefore, they need a different way to create a plan &#8211; particularly if the tolerance for failure is low and the need for caution is high, as is so often the case when innovating in education with children.  
In a discovery-driven planning process, the key is to start with the desired outcome in mind. From there, the crucial next step is to list all of the assumptions that must prove true in order to realize the desired outcomes and goals. With the assumptions in hand, the next step is to implement a plan to learn &#8211; as a way to test, as quickly and as possible, whether the critical assumptions are reasonable.&#8221; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Source: Blended: Using Disruptive Innovation to Improve Schools</span>  
**These carefully designed workshops combine theory with application to provide a step-by-step process for harnessing the most promising innovations to improve schools while avoiding the landmines.**
