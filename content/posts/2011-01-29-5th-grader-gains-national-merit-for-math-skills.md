Math can be a tricky subject at any age, but one 5th grader is making some national waves with his arithmetic skills.  
Brendan Suckley has recently achieved the #1 ranking on the online tutorial website apangea.com. It is a math website where students can work problems and receive online tutoring. The ranking is merit based. Students receive points for problems they solve while at school or at home. Brendan is number 1 out of 150 thousand students.  
Brendan hopes to be an engineer when he grows up.
