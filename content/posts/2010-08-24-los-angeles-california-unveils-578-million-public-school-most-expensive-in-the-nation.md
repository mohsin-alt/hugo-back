The most expensive school in the country was approved but didn&#8217;t impact the educational budget? Read on&#8230;  
&#8220;With an eye-popping price tag of $578 million, it will mark the inauguration of?[the nation&#8217;s most expensive public school][1] ever. The K-12 complex to house 4,200 students has raised eyebrows across the country as the creme de la creme of &#8216;Taj Mahal&#8217; schools, $100 million-plus campuses boasting both architectural panache and deluxe amenities. &#8230; At RFK, the features include fine art murals and a marble memorial depicting the complex&#8217;s namesake, a manicured public park, and a state-of-the-art swimming pool. &#8216;There&#8217;s no more of the old, windowless cinderblock schools of the &#8217;70s where kids felt, &#8220;Oh, back to jail,&#8221;&#8216; said Joe Agron, editor-in-chief of American School & University, a school construction journal. &#8216;Districts want a showpiece for the community, a really impressive environment for learning.&#8217; &#8230; Critics note that nearly 3,000 teachers have been laid off over the past two years, the academic year and programs have been slashed, the district faces a $640 million shortfall and some schools persistently rank among the nation&#8217;s lowest performing.&#8221;  
&#8220;Officials in LA say the new schools were planned before the economic crisis hit, and are funded by $20 billion in voter-approved bonds that do not impact the educational budget.&#8221;
