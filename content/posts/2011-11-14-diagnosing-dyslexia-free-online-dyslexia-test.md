**Why do I need a dyslexia test?**  
When there is a problem, it helps to understand that problem and have a label and explanation for it, because then &#8211; and only then &#8211; are we able to know where to go and what to do for help. We are offering a **<a title="Free Dyslexia Test" href="http://athome.readinghorizons.com/assessments/dyslexic-assessment-part1.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free dyslexia test</a>** created by a dyslexia tester and tutor to help you diagnose dyslexia in yourself or another.  
**What should I do to begin diagnosing dyslexia?**  
First, observe your children or become aware of your own <a title="12 Tips On Raising a Reader" href="http://athome.readinghorizons.com/research/12-tips-on-raising-a-reader.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reading habits</a>. If you are looking at your children, you need to watch how they deal with <a href="http://athome.readinghorizons.com/resources/language-library.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">language</a>: Were they slow to connect letter names and sounds? Do they have difficulty with rhyme? These are all indicators. The first part of our free dyslexia test deals with questions such as these and looks at your family history, which is another strong indicator of the possibility of a <a href="http://athome.readinghorizons.com/research/dyslexia.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dyslexia diagnosis.</a>

**What do I look for as I am diagnosing dyslexia?**  
Dyslexia symptoms while reading are not random; there is a consistent pattern.  
Here is a list of patterns to look for when diagnosing dyslexia:

  * Difficulty reading single words
  * Particular difficulty decoding nonsense or unfamiliar words
  * Reading comprehension is often superior to decoding individual words
  * Inaccurate and labored oral reading of passages
  * Trouble reading small &#8220;function&#8221; words:?_that, is, an, for_
  * The ability to sound out or read a word on one page and then on another page, or even just a few lines, and later inability to recognize or decode the same word
  * Poor memory for sequences, facts and information that has not been experienced
  * Slow reading
  * Poor spelling

**What does the free dyslexia test consist of?**  
According to Dr. Sally Shaywitz, author of Overcoming Dyslexia, there are three steps that must be followed for a dyslexia test:

  1. Establish a reading problem according to age and education.
  2. Gather evidence supporting its &#8220;unexpectedness&#8221;; high learning capability may be determined solely on the basis of an educational or professional level of attainment.
  3. Demonstrate evidence of an isolated phonologic weakness, with other higher-level language functions relatively unaffected.

**How do I accomplish these three steps of a dyslexia test?**

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Step 1: If you see any of the symptoms of dyslexia listed above and your child&#8217;s reading level is below what it should be, even though it is apparent that he/she is a bright child, then we have established the first part of the evaluation. When he/she is having reading struggles despite intelligence or effort, that is a strong indication you are dealing with dyslexia.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Step 2: The more observations you make to this end and the more evidence you gather showing a consistent struggle with reading and writing, then you have moved through the second step of the evaluation. The first part or our test will give further evidence to support this.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Step 3: Take the phonologic test that contains the recommended components of phonemic awareness and memory, reading words in isolation for decoding and nonsense words to look for specific phonological weaknesses.

**Do I really want a dyslexia diagnosis?**  
As parents, we are often hesitant to give a child a dyslexia diagnosis. There can be a great deal of negative association with words such as ds such as learning disability, Attention Deficit Disorder, and dyslexia. Dyslexia is an important term to help identify kids with reading difficulties and is one from which we need not shy away. It is important for children to understand that their reading difficulties come from the way their brains are wired and not their intelligence level. Giving a label gives an explanation and, therefore, can lead to a solution.  
This is how Dr. Orton, in his book Reading, Writing, and Speech Problems in Children , described the term dyslexia to a five-year-old: dys means problems, and lexia means words, so dyslexia means problems with the words you speak, the words you hear, and the words you see. Children and adults are so excited to have a word for it-one that explains what is going on.  
Katherine Schantz, head of the Delaware Valley Friends School, shares, &#8220;It&#8217;s just such a meaningful term, and the kids understand that their brain works differently and feel relieved.&#8221; We should not be afraid of the term, the label, but embrace it, explore it, and discuss it with our children so that they can receive the correct help and begin to find success with words.
