    <strong>Research Study</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The results are phenomenal.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Rigorous independent study:</strong> The study was conducted by an independent third party (state of Utah). It is publicly available. There were over 94,000 students in the study, including 6,500 Mathspace students. The study is highly rigorous and its results are reliable
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Mathspace is highly effective, especially for intervention:</strong> Each of the results shows how effective Mathspace was for students. Students demonstrated significant growth, particular those who began the year as not proficient.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Small amount of time required to produce results:</strong> While Mathspace produces positive results for all students, it is significant to see that using Mathspace for around 30 min per week generates significant results.
