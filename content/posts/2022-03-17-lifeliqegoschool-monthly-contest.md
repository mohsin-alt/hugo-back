**Lifeliqe GO: Gotta match ’em all**

_Lifeliqe Go: Gotta match ’em all_ highlights the usability of AR in spaces other than gaming, in particular, education. Taking a Lifeliqe 3D model and putting it in the right environment promotes learning more about the model, sparking curiosity in learners and making them explore for themselves while having fun and getting rewarded. It is great to use in classroom as a part of a class project, instantly rewarding with a month?s free subscription. Individual users are eligible to compete as well as schools (classes), the main prize will be awarded in both categories. The users share their creations on Facebook or Twitter and are encouraged to tell a story with their video/picture or in the title to amplify the impact and get more likes from the general public. The campaign will start 1st September, providing learners with a top-notch tool right in the start of the school year and continue on a monthly basis with a new round every month.
