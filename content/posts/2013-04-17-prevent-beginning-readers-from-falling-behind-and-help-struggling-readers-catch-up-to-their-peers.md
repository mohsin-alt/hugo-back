**Prevent Beginning Readers from Falling Behind, and Help Struggling Readers Catch Up to Their Peers!**  
The best way to ensure that all of your students develop effective reading skills is to implement what researchers have found to be the most effective approach: explicit, systematic, and multi-sensory reading instruction. The only problem: Teachers are rarely trained how to provide this type of instruction.  
For Grades K-3  
Reading Horizons Discovery helps K-3 students fulfill 92 percent of the requirements for foundational reading skills as outlined by the Common Core State Standards while preventing at-risk students from falling behind.

For Grades 4-12  
Reading Horizons provides low-level reading instruction in a way that appeals to older students. Corrective feedback is continuously delivered to help struggling readers and ESL students correct the reading habits that prevent them from making progress&#8211;leading to fast gains.

Reading Horizons makes English accessible to ESL students through a step-by-step process and language support in Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, and Haitian-Creole. A pronunciation tool shows the proper tongue and mouth placement for each of the sounds in the English language.
