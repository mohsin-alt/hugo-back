ADE houses an ?adult volunteer? website which offers two ways to approach volunteering: FIND one and/or BE one. Currently, ADE is soliciting schools in Arizona in need of volunteers; clicking on the following link: </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: blue; font-family: arial;"><a href="http://www.volunteersolutions.org/azde/volunteer/">http://www.volunteersolutions.org/azde/volunteer/</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Century Gothic'; color: black;"><span style="font-family: arial;"> will connect you to this resource. There?s a master calendar describing volunteering opportunities by date, and a list of volunteering opportunities to browse by topic ? from all over the world. When a school registers, it completes a profile which helps match its needs to volunteers available. </span></span>  
<big><strong style="font-family: arial;">Christopher Columbus Awards</strong></big>  
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">The Christopher Columbus Awards program asks students to use the scientific process to solve real-world problems and change their community. The challenge is for <span style="font-weight: bold;">teams of three to four middle school students</span> to identify a community issue and apply the scientific process to create an innovative solution for the problem. Comprehensive online project resources include a Student Guide, Coach/Teachers Guide and instructional tips on brainstorming, inquiry-based learning, scientific methods and national standards. Winning teams and their coaches will receive a trip to Walt Disney World for National Championship Week and a $2,000 U.S. Savings Bond for each team member.<br /> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Deadline: February 9, 2009 </span><br /> For more information, visit: <a href="http://www.christophercolumbusawards.com/">http://www.christophercolumbusawards.com/</a></span>

Others have argued for this and failed. But few have the power of Bill Gates.? The foundation?s director of education programs said the group hopes to write its own standards and its own national test. Once these are developed, the foundation said any state can get the materials for free.</span>
