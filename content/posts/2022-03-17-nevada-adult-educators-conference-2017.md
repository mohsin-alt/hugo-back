Backbone Communications Presentations for Nevada Adult Educators Conference.  
March 15, 2017 at the Tropicana Las Vegas.

**“Crack the Code” Improving Literacy for Struggling Readers: an Explicit, Systematic, Multi-Sensory approach to Reading Instruction.**

Find out how to ?Crack the Code? with the Reading Horizons? methodology and learn some simple steps to boost students? reading performance and confidence. Reading Horizons incorporates multi-sensory, Orton-Gillingham principles of instruction and a unique marking system into its approach. Learn about this engaging, appealing, and sensible framework that retrains the brain to recognize patterns in the English language and promotes reading success.

**Online Curriculum for Adult Learners for HSE & Adult HS Diplomas**

We provide the framework for adult learners with Assessments & Individualized Learning Paths based on competency, with Grade 5-12 content aligned to NDE Standards & approved for credit by NDE Distance Ed, that offers HSE, HSPE, HiSET and EOC Prep, and/or the opportunity to earn an Adult HS Diploma.

**CTE and Career Readiness**

The economy has changed and so has the way we prepare students for their future. Vocational training for a few has evolved into career and technical education (CTE) for all students. The new economy beckons with high-skill, high-demand jobs for students right out of school as well as for college graduates.

School district administrators and state policymakers are rallying to transform America?s high schools in order to address these new economic needs. Career readiness programs are igniting a passion for learning in students, increasing their engagement levels at school and providing them opportunities for training and certifications. Online and blended learning offers an ideal solution for districts looking to transform their schools and expand their CTE offerings quickly, affordably, and thoroughly. 90% of students in CTE programs graduate, which outpaces the overall national graduation rate of 81%. 81% of students who didn?t finish high school say relevant, real-world learning opportunities would have kept them in school. Offer Certification exam preparation for Workforce readiness, Nationally recognized certifications, and Career exploration and Business skills development. Equip your students for the challenges of college, career and life.
