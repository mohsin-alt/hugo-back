Do your students ever have a heard time remembering what they have read? In this webinar, Reading Horizons Teacher Trainer, Jay Kelly, will discuss how working memory plays into student reading and how to help students increase their comprehension.  
In this webinar educators will learn the answers to questions such as, ?Have you ever had a student who could remember small details from a story but couldn&#8217;t recall larger, more-significant elements?? or ?Have you ever had a student who understood instruction on Wednesday but on Thursday had virtually no recall of that instruction?? Teachers will also learn how to help students who understand a specific concept but who have significant difficulty connecting it to other related concepts. Teachers will learn the warning signs of working memory weakness and methods of instruction to help minimize the impact of those weaknesses.  
This webinar will be presented by Jay Kelly who has over 17 years experience in teaching, writing and training. His current work focuses on training teachers to work with struggling readers, working one-on-one with reading students, and developing practical teaching strategies for struggling readers based on current neurological research. Jay holds an MA in Philosophy from the University of Oklahoma where his research centered around critical thinking processes, logic and philosophy of mind.
