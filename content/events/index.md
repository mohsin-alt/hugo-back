## Local Workshops

Sponsored workshops, learning events, and symposiums are designed to bring educators together to learn about successful implementations. Often times, school representatives and administrators volunteer to share the details of success along with the challenges and difficulties in getting there. With the wide range of behavioral and academic challenges, unique strategies and procedures are designed to put the student first that are essential in the success of the program. This is a great opportunity to hear from experts in the fields of reading, curriculum, assessments, Common Core and differentiated learning as they share best practices and methodologies to increase student achievement.

## Presentations

On-site school and district centered demonstrations allow teachers and administrators the freedom to ask questions and interact with the technology and materials. Face-to-face interaction allows teachers and administrators to become familiar and fully confident with educational technology. Onsite presentations provide the opportunity for group participation and focused application based on the needs of the individual school or district.
