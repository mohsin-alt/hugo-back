  “As a Special Education Supervisor, it is my responsibility to assure that staff have quality supports that allow them to work better, not harder. Access has also fostered a climate of transparency and collaboration between schools and families as families in our district are able to view the resources and the programs assigned to their children.”
</h1>

Debra S. Pearce, M.Ed. Supervisor of Special Education St. Mary?s County Public Schools, MD

#### Increase competency through workshops utilizing ABA evidence-based practices for knowledge and skill development to increase staff competency (i.e. inclusion, managing challenging behaviors, behavior management, applied behavior analysis, Autism Spectrum Disorder).

What percentage of students on your campus have special needs, and how do you address them? We offer online workshops and support for districts who are interested in implementing an inclusion model, which allows special needs students the opportunity to spend most of their instructional time in the least restrictive environment (LRE).

 

Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a scientific, systematic, and evidence-based approach to understanding and changing behavior in order to improve people?s lives. By analyzing how an individual?s current behaviors function ? meaning how those behaviors meet certain needs in a particular environment ? a behavior analyst can identify ways to modify the environment and teach new skills that will improve an individual?s health and safety, ability to communicate, social relationships and independence.

For example, in an ABA session, a behavior therapist will reinforce desired behaviors or functional skills by providing desired outcomes, such as a candy, toys, games, praise, etc., when a desired behavior is exhibited. Behavior therapists will withhold reinforcements when undesired behaviors, such as tantrums and aggression, are displayed. Students quickly learn that desired behaviors will easily and rapidly bring them desired results, whereas undesired behaviors will not bring about desired outcomes.

Over time, prompts and rewards are gradually removed to help the student learn to integrate desirable behavior in natural environments.

Read more about a Behavior Management System to screen and assess the student and automatically prescribe effective Proactive Strategies, Replacement Behaviors, and Reactive Strategies to meet IEP and Behavior goals [HERE][1].
