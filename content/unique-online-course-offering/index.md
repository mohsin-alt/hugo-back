– Students can engage in simulations including virtual labs and simulated dialogs with avatars.  
– Students can participate in cloze activities which provide a structure to repeat and practice.  
– Students can organize, categorize, match and memorize information and concepts utilizing memorable, interactive graphics.  
– Students work to complete questions, self-assessments, study guides, and other assignments

Online courses can be implemented as supplementary to classroom instruction or as a replacement. Online courses allow administrators the flexibility of offering a plethora of classes, many more than the school originally intended to offer. Upper level AP courses and world language courses to unique electives such as Law & Order, Gothic Literature, and Real World Parenting enable a school to aggressively attract students without needing to plan for an expected enrollment or additional staff support. Extensive ongoing training and professional development is provided to staff so that implementation of an online program is smooth and efficient. Adding an online education component will increase a school or district’s enrollment numbers, student engagement, and graduation rates.
