By receiving quality instruction delivered in a career and workplace context, learners experience the direct connection between core foundational skills including reading, navigating and locating information, and the core foundational skills required across occupations and industries to compete and succeed in today’s world.

Career readiness begins with providing labor market information, interest assessments, and personalized electronic counseling tools which together give learners the opportunity to explore and determine their career interests and/or specific career pathway goals. Career profiles in the software then direct learners to the foundational and soft skills training necessary to begin the journey along their chosen career pathway. Students can move from identifying their career interest to local demand and alignment to occupations and careers. Further, students receive the education and training for college and career success. While career and college readiness have long been recognized standards in higher education and workforce training programs, this important component of the educational realm is now seen as critical to quality instruction at every level from kindergarten on.

Whether implementing the Common Core Standards and Assessments (future), state-specific standards, or aligning instruction to nationally recognized assessments such as the COMPASS, TABE, ASVAB, GED, SAT9 or WorkKeys, educators, administrators, and employers desire tools that ensure learners are making regular, provable progress toward being truly ready for their next step when transitioning to high school, college, employment, or changing careers.

Preparing for success in the workforce takes more than a proficiency in reading, English, math and science. Non-cognitive “soft” skills are just as important. In fact, a recent study by the Harvard Graduate School of Education found 46% of all first time hires lost their job in their first 18 months of employment, 10% from a lack of business skills, and 90% from soft skill deficiencies. Over the next 10 years, 70% of today’s high school freshman will be in the workforce without a college degree, while most will have received limited training in these critical 21st century career skills.

If you truly want to prepare your students for success in the world of business where skills like Attitude, Communication, Interpersonal, Work Ethic, Leadership, and Critical Thinking matter most are important, contact Backbone Communications and let us help you align your College and Career Ready goals with our proven solutions.
