Experts agree that learning a second language during early childhood is a sure fire way to put children on a track to academic success. Exposing children to a second language while young allows them to maximize their academic potential, shaping the young brain while still at a flexible age. Small children are very well suited to early exposure to language acquisition, as research shows that learning a second language at a young age is cognitively as easy as learning a first language.

 

Research shows that there are additional cognitive benefits to learning a second language at a very young age. Studies indicate that students in a language program consistently achieve higher performance in all fundamental skills in the early grades. According to data released by the College Entrance Examination Board, such students go on to score higher on college entrance exams than monolingual students. Children who learn a foreign language at a young age also exhibit better success in problem-solving skills, accelerated spatial reasoning, and dramatically increased creativity. Learning a second language encourages flexible thinking and improved written and verbal communication, allowing children to evaluate issues from more than one perspective, with the added benefit of increased success in all areas of language arts based content.

Additionally, research shows that multilingual students have enhanced memory and multi tasking abilities, as well as overall higher skills in planning and preparation. When learning multiple languages at an early age, the brain is trained to attend to salient information and to disregard non-essential information, a skill that later supports better focus, memory, planning and multitasking abilities. Research shows that multilingual individuals use more of their brains than monolinguals and outperform monolinguals on creativity tests.

Linguists have come to the conclusion that immersion learning helps people of all ages to gain a stronger base of comprehension and to accelerate language acquisition. An online language acquisition program should offer authentic materials and frequent opportunities to interact in the target language using reading, writing, listening and speaking activities in a digital format.

Recent budget cuts, school population size, and many other factors contribute to a school?s inability to offer classroom teachers of foreign languages. A well-rounded, research-based, customizable online program with teachers of record is allowing schools and districts of all sizes and populations to expose students to languages of the world.
